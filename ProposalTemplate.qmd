## Data Set

"Students_Grading_Dataset_Bias.csv"

## Research Questions

1.  What are the effects of attenance %, axtracurriculars, parent education and stress level have on student performance.

2.  Is there a relationship between levels of stress and academic performance?

3.  How does the number of study hours/week impact total score among students?

4.  How does sleep hours per night impact student stress scores / grades.

## Data Processing and Preparation

Describe what variables you will use and what subset of observations. Make a few exploritory data analysis figures or tables to show the data you will use.

### Outcome(s)

-   Total Score, Stress Level, Grade

### Predictors

What predictor variables will you use? How will they be included in the model? For example, are they random effects? Will any be nonlinear? Will you include interaction terms? Are they continuous or categorical and how will you handle cateogrical variables?

### Subsample

Will you use all observations on only a subset of observations? If a subset, how will you select them and why?

### Other

Are there missing values and, if so, how will you handle missing data?

Are any variables skewed or have outliers that are of concern? If so, how will you handle this?

## Modeling Approach

What model(s) do you propose to use? You may want to specify the model as a hierarchical model.

How will you estimate your model?
